# Asybot
Simple Discord bot written in Python using Py-Cord, with the goal of trying to make a belivable person who chats at random
intervals, and remembers others' actions and general sentiment towards them.

Currently, it uses a model of your choosing using [Cloudflare AI](https://ai.cloudflare.com/).

This README is a work in progress, and will be updated as the bot is developed.
